<p><center>yes, the child you see with incredible drip and a mean ass mug is me (I tried to somewhat hide the identity of my family for privacy but it just ended up lookin like a crime documentary where I killed my mom and sister smh)
but hello, I'm Danielle Jalotjot, but you can call me Dani. if you were wondering, the proper way to pronounce my last name is huh-lut-hut. I'm a 22 y/o transfer at SJSU, or a super senior. I've always loved consuming and creating art, and plan to do it for a long time. I've mainly drawn traditionally with mediums like graphite and ink, but recently I've transitioned my focus to digital drawing. I know I have so much to learn and experiment with, so I'm very excited for this journey hehe. I hope being in the DMA program at SJSU will open new doors for me and my art :^)
I hope you enjoyed looking around and thank u for stopping by! <br/><br/>
xoxo dani<center></p>
